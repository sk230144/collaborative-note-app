- Real-time Collaboration: Simulate real-time collaboration using shared state (e.g., localStorage).
- Version History: Track, view, and restore previous versions of notes with timestamps or identifiers.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calming blue (#64B5F6) to evoke a sense of trust and focus for collaborative work.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) for a clean and distraction-free writing environment.
- Accent color: A vibrant green (#4CAF50) to highlight important actions and collaboration features.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text, ensuring a clean and modern look.
- Use HeroUI's built-in icon set for a consistent and modern look. Icons should be intuitive and directly related to their functions.
- A clean and responsive layout using HeroUI's grid system, optimized for different screen sizes. Prioritize readability and ease of navigation.
- Subtle animations for transitions and feedback to improve the user experience. For example, a smooth fade-in effect when opening a note or saving changes.
